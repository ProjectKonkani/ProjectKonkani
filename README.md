#Working
  there is only one folder to run the program on
    1. on opening the folder run "npm i" or "npm install"
    2. make sure the required package.json files are present
    3. the "react-timeline-component" package might cause problems in the future, so if its installed on the general npm command, manually delete it.
    4. run "npm run start"
    5. the project should be good to go.

  #error fixes
    1. Most of the components are absolute. Therefore, responsiveness is completely off. 
    2. versal rendering is used, since the project is not fully optimized, the website rendering can vary on the internet connection (have a good internet connection)
    3. offset time must be taken care of while working on the project (in file par.js)

  Any information and help is appreciated for the improvement of the project. do contact via Github and also the corresponding collaborators.
  thank you, and ExPeriMEnt!
